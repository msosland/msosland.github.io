      <p class="aboot"> Hi! My name is Marshall Sosland, and I am currently a member of the Squirrels 2016 cohort at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, Illinois. Before ramping up my knowledge of programming, web development, and computer science through self-study in 2015, I managed a commodity trading desk for several years in Chicago. </p><p class="aboot"> My transition has been influenced by my desire to never stop learning, and I am very excited to be working in a domain that is constantly evolving and in a field that has limitless potential to create meaningful output.</p>
      <p class="aboot">
        I have an unquenchable desire to explore both the vast amounts of information and knowledge available to our generation and the wide swaths of the world that are perhaps a little less traveled. Five days after leaving my last job, my perpetual curiosity took me to Mongolia, where I backpacked for two weeks and captured the image displayed on this site's homepage.
