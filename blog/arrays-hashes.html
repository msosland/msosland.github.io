        <h2>[Introduction to Arrays and Hashes in Ruby]</h2>


        <article id="article">
          <h4>December 6, 2015 </h4>
          <p>
            In Ruby and other programming languages, there are multiple ways to deal with large collections of objects or data. In today's post, I am going to introduce two popular Ruby classes, Arrays and Hashes, that are frequently used as container objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both arrays and hashes are collections of objects. The code to create each of them is very similar. Each class has a <span class="solocode">.new</span> method, which can be used to create a new container. To create an array or hash using this method, you can type:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            array = Array.new <br>
            hash = Hash.new
          </div>
          <p>
            Another common way to create a container is using the literal constructor. To create an empty array or hash this way you only need to type:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            array = [] <br>
            hash = {}
          </div>
          <p>
            There are other ways arrays and hashes can be created, including by specifying values instead of creating empty containers. The two examples below will show one of the main differences between the two classes:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] <br>
            hash = {"ruby" => "red", "sky" => "blue", "snow" => "white"}
          </div>
          <p>
            The above illustrates one of the primary differences between arrays and hashes. Arrays are collections of individual objects, whereas hashes are collections of key:value pairs of objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objects inside arrays and hashes are not limited to primitive data types like integers or strings. An array or hash could contain any number of different types of objects within, including strings, integers, or floats, as well as other arrays or hashes!
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            funky_array = [1, "two", 3.14, [-27, "red"]] <br>
            funky_hash = <br>{"Bob" => {"City" => "Dallas",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"State" => "Texas",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occupation" => "Cowboy"},<br> "Lisa" => {"City" => "Chicago", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"State" => "Illinois", <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occupation" => "Astronaut"}}
          </div>
          <p>
            Because of the structure of each of these two containers, an array may be more useful for a linear list of elements. An array could hold a large collection of numbers, for example, which could then be sorted or searched through rather quickly. Arrays are integer-indexed starting at 0, so the first element in an array is located at index 0, the second at index 1, etc. To access the third element, you can type:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            special = funky_array[2]
          </div>
          <p>
            The variable <span class="solocode">special</span> would now be set to <span class="solocode">3.14</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hashes are also ordered in the sense that Ruby remembers the order that the keys were inserted; however, the best way to access a value in a hash is by the key:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            information = funky_hash["Bob"]
          </div>
          <p>
            which would then set the variable <span class="solocode">information</span> to the hash to which the key <span class="solocode">Bob</span> points. </p><p>Hashes may best be used for dictionaries or data sets where, for example, a large number of unique customers (keys) each map to another hash or collection of data. And indeed, one requirement of hashes is that in any given hash, keys must be unique. But whereas in arrays the keys are essentially the integer indices, the keys in hashes are much more flexible and can be any of a number of objects as long as they are unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both container objects have additional features, such as the ability to remove, add, or retrieve specific objects, as well as different techniques for traversing across their datasets. Further, both the Array class and the Hash class have many other built-in Ruby methods, which can be pleasure-read on the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby Docs</a> website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, it is very important to be able to manage and manipulate large collections of objects in any programming language, and arrays and hashes are two common ways of handling the data in Ruby. I hope this article has been an informative introduction to the two classes. Until next time...
