          <p>
            Everything in Ruby is an object. In simple Ruby programs, some of the most common objects are strings, integers, arrays, and hashes. Every object is part of a Ruby Class. There is a String Class, a Hash Class, and a Fixnum Class, and there is also a NilClass, a Symbol Class, and many error classes, just to identify a few. In fact, every object in Ruby has a <span class="solocode">class</span> method that identifies its class:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            1.class<br>
            >> Fixnum<br>
            "string".class<br>
            >> String<br>
            true.class<br>
            >> TrueClass<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            So what are classes and why are they useful? A typical class consists of a bundle of methods and properties. They allow the creation of many instances of objects to share common behaviors. Creating a class and defining all of the properties of the objects of that class is much easier than creating multiple objects and redefining each object's behavior from scratch. For example, whenever an array is created, it immediately has access to all of the Array Class methods - they do not have to be redefined every time an array is created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at an example where creating a class may be useful. Suppose a gym wants to keep track of all its members in a database. One good way to keep track of many similar object instances is to create a class.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            class Member<br>
            end<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            Okay, so far our Member class does not have any properties yet. The first thing we will want to do is initialize an object of class Member with a few key properties.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            class Member<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(start_date, age)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age = age<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start_date = start_date<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
            end<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            The code above may look a little complicated, but it is actually pretty straightforward. The <span class="solocode">initialize</span> method is an optional class method that is run automatically whenever a new instance of the class is created. Because the <span class="solocode">initialize</span> method takes two parameters, those parameters are required every time a new object of Member class is created. However, the class does not have to be built this way - you could build a class where no initial parameters are necessary, and those properties are instead added later. In this case however, it may make sense that all new members should immediately have a start date and age.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, what is the <span class="solocode">initialize</span> method above doing? The method is taking as input a start date and age and turning them into instance variables. Instance variables are noticeable by the @ before the variable name, which otherwise looks similar to a local variable. The instance variable does not have to share the same name as a local variable it might be representing, but in this case it helps make the code read easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instance variables are different from local variables because of their wider scope. For example, instance variables can be accessed within other class methods. They are useful in situations which each instance of the class is going to have relatively fixed unique properties - no member object is going to have two ages or two start dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's now create two more methods: one to get a member's age, and one to update a user's age:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            class Member<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(start_date, age)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age = age<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start_date = start_date<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;def set_age(new_age)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age = new_age<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;def get_age<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
            end<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now you can call the methods set_age and age to set and get the user's age. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            Helen = Member.new("1/1/2015", 29)<br>
            Helen.get_age<br>
            >> 29<br>
            Helen.set_age(30)<br>
            >> 30<br>
            Helen.get_age<br>
            >> 30<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            (Note: if the <span class="solocode">@age</span> instance variable was not created, get_age would not be able to access the local variable <span class="solocode">age</span> unless an object (or age) was passed in as a parameter.)
          <p>
            Those methods are nice, but for some classes, each object will need to have many instance variables. The Member Class may include variables for gender, current fitness level, current trainer, weight, and more. Rather than write out a get method and set method for every single instance variable in order to return or change that variable, Ruby has a built-in shorter version. The <span class="solocode">attr_*</span> family of methods replaces the get and set methods. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            class Member<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_reader :age, :start_date<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_writer :age<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(start_date, age)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age = age<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@start_date = start_date<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
            end<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            The above <span class="solocode">attr_reader</span> and <span class="solocode">attr_writer</span> methods automatically replace the <span class="solocode">get</span> and <span class="solocode">set</span> methods, respectively. Thus, you can still get a Member's age by typing <span class="solocode">Helen.age</span> as before, and you can now set a Member's age by typing <span class="solocode">Helen.age = 30</span>. In our above class, you can access a Member's start_date with <span class="solocode">Helen.start_date</span>, but you cannot change the start date because there is no <span class="solocode">attr_writer :start_date</span> (or <span class="solocode">set_start_date</span>) method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, variables like <span class="solocode">@age</span> that have both <span class="solocode">get</span> and <span class="solocode">set</span> abilities can be listed with the <span class="solocode">attr_accessor</span> method in the same location as the <span class="solocode">attr_reader</span> and <span class="solocode">attr_writer</span> methods. The <span class="solocode">attr_accessor</span> method creates both the read and write methods in one line for a given variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many more methods can be created under one class. A Member object might have not only several unique properties, but also have many other methods that can be sent to it. Using a class and defining the methods within that class allow our gym to create many unique instance objects which all have similar Ruby abilities. As mentioned at the beginning of this post, whenever an Array object is created, it immediately has access to all the methods of the Array Class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you have received an introduction to Ruby classes, can you think of other programs that may require the creation of a new class? How would you implement it?
