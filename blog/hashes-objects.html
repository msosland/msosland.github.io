        <h2>[Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects]</h2>


        <article id="article">
          <h4>December 22, 2015 </h4>
          <p>
            In Ruby, hashes are used to store data in key-value pairs. In JavaScript, objects store data in pairs also, and they are typically described as name-value or property-value pairs. In this article I will look at the similarities and differences between the two structures. From here on, 'objects' will refer to JavaScript objects, even though Ruby hashes are of course also objects in Ruby.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a new empty hash is very similar to creating a new empty object.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            //JavaScript <br>
            var obj = new Object();<br>
            var obj2 = {};<br>
            <br>
            #Ruby<br>
            hash = Hash.new<br>
            hash2 = {}<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            The syntax differences widen as we start to add value pairs into each one. First, let's look at initializing a hash and object with pairs already:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            //JavaScript <br>

            var obj3 = {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;firstName: "Helen",<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;lastName: "Smith",<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;age: 30<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;spouse: {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstName: "Joe",<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lastName: "Smith",<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 30<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            };<br>
            <br>
            #Ruby<br>
            hash3 = {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;"first_name" => "Helen",<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;:last_name => "Smith",<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;age: 30,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;spouse: {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_name: "Joe",<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_name: "Smith",<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age: 30<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            }<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            Alright! The above should convey that the essence of the two structures is almost identical. Syntactically though, there are several differences. There are multiple ways to write Ruby key-value pairs: in the above instance, one key is written as a string, the next as a symbol with a leading colon, and the next as a symbol with a trailing colon. The <span class="solocode">=></span> is used at times and not at others (though it would never be proper convention to mix and match within the same hash or even the same program). Meanwhile, in the JavaScript above, there is really only one way to write out the property, with the colon after the property name. Another important feature for both structures is the ability to nest other types of data structures inside. Above, a hash is nested inside of a hash, and a JavaScript object is nested inside of the original object. </p><p>In Ruby, <strong><em>any</em></strong> object can be a key or value. So a key could be an array, hash, integer, string, or any other Ruby object. In a JavaScript object, the properties must be converted to strings. Consider the following:
          <div class="code">
            //JavaScript<br>
            var array = [1, 2, 3];<br>
            var obj = {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;array: "array",<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;45: "number"<br>
            };<br>

            for (var key in obj)<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log (typeof key)<br>
            <br>
            >> string<br>
            >> string<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            Above, both the array and number are converted to strings when they are added as properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding values to existing hashes or objects is similar, though JavaScript commonly uses dot notation when the property name is a valid variable name, while Ruby uses bracket notation. JavaScript does allow bracket notation as well, which is useful for when the string property name has a space or is a number, for example.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            //JavaScript<br>
            obj3.middleName = "Lisa";<br>
            obj3["favoriteColor"] = "blue";<br>
            <br>
            #Ruby<br>
            hash3["middle_name"] = "Lisa"<br>
            hash3["favorite_color"] = "blue"<br>
          </div>
          <p>
            Last but not least, Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects each have their own built-in methods and they do differ. The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Hash.html">Ruby Docs</a> will have all the hash methods, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Mozilla Developer Network</a> has the object functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few similar methods/functions, such as the Ruby <span class="solocode">has_key?</span> method and the JavaScript <span class="solocode">hasOwnProperty</span> function, but there are many different ones, so I urge you to check the documentation out!
          </p><p>
            Hope this has been a helpful comparison of Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects. Until next time...
