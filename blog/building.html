          <h4>January 18, 2016 </h4>
          <p>
            This week I introduced myself to the world of static site generators and website frameworks. I primarily read about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> from the first category and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> from the second. Ultimately, after diving into multiple rabbit holes, my website remains little changed. Here are a few thoughts. </p>
            <p>
            I spent many, many hours trying to decide on the right tools to use. I read about Jekyll, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, among other static site generators. I looked at a few different frameworks, though Bootstrap and Foundation stuck out to me. And my initial research essentially paralyzed me, because a lot of time was spent debating instead of implementing. </p>
            <p> Finally, near the end of this week, I decided to use Jekyll first, and I did successfully get my site back up and running with Jekyll. However, the product was poor and required a lot more time and effort than I had to give this week. For now, I have decided to switch my site back to the original format. </p>
            <p> Building this website as it stands today has been beneficial to me because I have created all of the design from scratch. But I have also learned a few lessons from my research into overhauling my website. Primarily, I know that I eventually want to have experience using several static site generators and at least a few frameworks as well. So when I revisit the idea of changing my website, I will spend less time deciding what to do and more time getting experience implementing one idea at a time.
            </p>
            <p> In the next few months, I will be very busy with Dev Bootcamp in Chicago, but by the time I am through, I will deploy a much more refined website. Stay tuned!</p>
