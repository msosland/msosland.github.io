How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? <br>
    I enjoyed it. We were able to screenshare on Mockingbird while
    building the template and use JSfiddle to type out the html.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Yes. As soon as we had completed the wireframe, the html came
    very easily. It was much easier than trying to picture the frame
    while typing the code from scratch.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? <br>
    We each want to keep our individual headers and footers from
    our index page on each subsequent page, so we started by blocking
    off horizontal space at the top and bottom for those. We used an
    underlying grid to help measure and estimate where content should
    go. We label all of our boxes, and the wireframe helps show
    how the spacing would work between elements.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? <br>
    My pair encouraged us to avoid throwing around too many divs,
    so we used two section elements instead. We incorporated the
    article element and the nav element as well.
